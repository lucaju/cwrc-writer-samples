              <p>When I reached Oslo yesterday evening, Brynjulf Bull should have been there to meet
                 me, but wasn't. He is not on the telephone, so I took a taxi to his address, which
                 turned out to be a students' club with no one about on Sundays, so I went to a hotel
                 feeling rather non-plussed. But presently he turned up. He had got the<pb cert="high" xml:space="default" n="2"/>
                 time of my arrival wrong, and 
                    when
                    
                  he had found he had missed me he phoned to every hotel in Oslo till he hit
                 on the right one. He left me at 10, and then I had to do a Sunday Referee article.
                 Today my journey lasts from 9 till 9 - fortunately one of the most beautiful railway
                 journeys in the world. Tomorrow I lecture at Bergen to the Anglo-Norwegian
                 Society. Next day I go back to Oslo, lecture there Fri. and Sat. and then start for
                 home via Bergen.</p>

              <p>Bull is a nice young man but incompetent - can't quite stand the communists, but
                 finds the socialists too mild.</p>
              <p>I am unhappily wondering what you are feeling about me.</p>
