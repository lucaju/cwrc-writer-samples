        <p>I have had no letter from you since I left <placeName>Stockholm</placeName>, but I had a nice one from John in an envelope you had sent him. I had sent him one addressed to Copenhagen but he hadn't used it.</p>
        <p>When I reached Oslo yesterday evening, Brynjulf Bull should have been there to meet me, but wasn't. He is not on the telephone, so I took a taxi to his address, which turned out to be a students' club with no one about on Sundays, so I went to a hotel feeling rather non-plussed. But presently he turned up. He had got the <pb></pb> time of my arrival wrong, and <choice>when</choice>he had found he had missed me he phoned to every hotel in Oslo till he hit on the right one. He left me at 10, and then I had to do a Sunday Referee article. Today my journey lasts from 9 till 9 - fortunately one of the most beautiful railway journeys in the world. Tomorrow I lecture at <placeName>Bergen</placeName> to the Anglo-Norwegian Society. Next day I go back to Oslo, lecture there Fri. and Sat. and then start for home via Bergen.</p>
        <pb></pb>
        <p>Bull is a nice young man but incompetent - can't quite stand the communists, but finds the socialists too mild.</p>
        <p>I am unhappily wondering what you are feeling about me.</p>

          <salute>I love you very much -</salute>
