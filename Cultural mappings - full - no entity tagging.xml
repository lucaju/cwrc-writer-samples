                    <ref target="#technology">In our research, virtually all of us write digitally: we use email, Internet resources, and word processing software as key tools in our scholarly work. But email connects us fleetingly, Internet resources often resemble individual silos, and our research remains in word processing files on our hard drives until it emerges, in print or digital form, to be read or studied—but not used interactively or reused in a digital environment. <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr> aims to create a new forum for literary research in and about Canada. <ref target="#collaboration"><ref target="#writing_climate">The forum will make it easier for scholars to work together and share the raw materials of their research (such as bibliographies, annotations, timelines, or digitized primary texts) with each other and the wider scholarly community. It also will offer an innovative, non-traditional online venue for publishing and connecting research results. <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr> particularly aims to support the work of junior scholars by mentoring, providing mechanisms for tracking and reporting collaborative contributions, and offering a welcoming space where users may explore the potential of digital research tools.</ref></ref></ref>

The scholars whose work is represented in this volume represent a fraction of those affiliated with <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr>. This participation—by scholars who wish to carry forward individual projects into a collaborative environment, by colleagues who focus on technical aspects of the Collaboratory, by extensive team projects such as the Canadian Women’s Writing Project or Editing Modernism in Canada—is essential to building <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr> into an environment that will meet scholars’ wide-ranging needs.</ref>

So long as we provide the basis for making computer-friendly connections among digital scholarly materials, the wealth of materials produced—bio-critical profiles of writers, bibliographies, readerly or critical responses, analysis patterns in publishing or poetics—will be used within the <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr> environment to facilitate the emergence of as yet unforeseen connections, including to place and space. <ref target="#attitudes_to_women_writing">In this respect, the Collaboratory emerges from the Orlando Project housed at the University of Alberta—upon whose systems <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr> builds—and its vision of the potential for computers to serve feminist literary studies. Canada needs better online representation of the strength of its women’s writing and fuller and more inclusive scholarly accounts: this volume highlights the potential for both to enrich our understanding of Canada’s cultural wealth.</ref></ref>

Orlando’s bio-critical entries on writers thus contain rich spatial information, as do the bibliographical and contextual event material. Among Orlando’s more than eight million words of born-digital scholarship, there are (at the time of writing) a total of 65,488 place tags and a total of 10,657 unique place names. <ref target="#technology">On the basis of this extensive set of materials, the Orlando and <abbr>CWRC</abbr> teams have conducted experimental geographical visualizations as a means of exploring how best to implement mapping functionality within the Collaboratory platform.

Moreover, the project’s historical sweep soon made it evident that many places require definition in time as well as space in order to be represented meaningfully, particularly since place names and boundaries have changed over the course of British (and international) history. Location is similarly pertinent to matters of biography and literary reception. Visualizations may be space-dominant or time-dominant, and one of our challenges is to better integrate spatial and temporal dimensions in the production of geographical representations of literary history, as Ian Gregory advocates in <title level="m">Exploiting Time and Space: A Challenge for <abbr>GIS</abbr> in the Digital Humanities.</title></ref>

We processed all place names returned by these search parameters into the form of events with spatial and temporal co-ordinates. <ref target="#non-book_media">In so doing, we avoided the necessity of visualizing all of Orlando’s spatial information in a single, temporally conflated map. In the absence of temporal information embedded in the spatial data itself, we drew on the fact that Orlando’s documents organize information in roughly chronological order to provisionally infer the temporality associated with a place by extrapolating from adjacent dated material. Based on this process of inference, each instance of geographical information produced by the initial extraction process was associated with a specific date or range of dates, the writer’s name, and the subject discussed, as well as the complete excerpt of the prose under each location as mentioned in Orlando.</ref></ref></ref>

Second, there will be an inherent unevenness in the granularity of the spatial data across the project as a whole.

Other projects will produce spatial data more casually, in keeping with standard biographical, critical, or bibliographical methods.</ref></ref> <ref target="#collaboration">Thus, <abbr>CWRC</abbr> maps rendered from data produced across the Collaboratory will differ considerably from maps created by single projects.

Hence, the rhetoric of the interface will need to signal that the map is not a finished product but an interpretive tool, one of several offered by the Collaboratory.</ref>

There is yet a further source of unevenness within <abbr>CWRC</abbr>: differences in the extent to which contextualizing semantic data is present within and across projects in the Collaboratory.

An ideal mapping interface would allow efficient processing and visualization of large quantities of spatial data in a web environment, easy faceting according to a range of criteria, and manual sifting of results, plus quick reference to the source text.</ref>

                                        <ref target="#technology">Our early experimental work tackles only a few of the more obvious complexities of spatial and temporal mapping. We are also keenly aware that our pragmatic experimentation with existing open source tools means that, to date, we have relied on existing conventions for representation of space that may be inherently out of step with the nature of our undertaking. As Johanna Drucker urges, humanities visualization needs <q>interpretations that arise in observer-codependence, characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty, as the basis on which a representation is constructed</q> to create <q>a map whose basic coordinate grid is constructed as an effect of these ambiguities</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Drucker par. 2</bibl></note>. The systems with which we have experimented thus far cannot begin to support such a nuanced model of spatial visualization. How best to address the mapping needs of literary scholars within <abbr>CWRC</abbr>, given the available resources, continues to drive our research. We look forward to learning what affordances other spatial visualization systems, such as Neatline with its attempt to incorporate an interpretive, humanistic perspective, can offer, and how we might adapt them to the kind of <ref target="#collaboration">collaborative, spontaneous, serendipitous mapping environment that <abbr>CWRC</abbr> hopes to support.</ref> <abbr>CWRC</abbr> also hopes to incorporate more focused, curated mapping work. Creating even a relatively simple environment within which scholars of wide-ranging perspectives can play with place and space as part of their respective investigations will help advance scholarly reflection on mapping itself and discovery of what kinds of mapping are most conducive to scholarly analysis and interpretation in the field of literary historical studies. But we know we still have considerable ground to cover.</ref>

The problem of funding, however, pales in comparison to a bigger challenge: developing viable models of collaboration.</ref> If the Editing Modernism in Canada (<abbr>EMiC</abbr>) knowledge network, for example, of which our group at the University of Alberta (<abbr>EMiC UA</abbr>) is part, wants researchers—faculty and students—in a number of disciplines to <q>collaborate, edit, learn</q> <note place="inline"><bibl><title level="a">About Us</title></bibl></note>, it needs to develop working environments in which ground rules are collaboratively developed and clearly articulated and in which all project members can thrive.</ref>

One challenge is working across traditional disciplinary boundaries within the humanities themselves—between English and theatre or art history, for example—a difficulty that should neither be overlooked nor underestimated.</ref> <ref target="#collaboration">Collaborating within a discipline is no easy matter; it involves not only adjusting to another researcher’s personality, understanding the subject in question and each other’s work habits, but also trusting that the additional work necessitated by collaboration is more than offset by the reward. <ref target="#technology">Collaborating on a digital humanities project, however, involves working not just across disciplinary boundaries but also at what Brown terms <q>the interface of the digital-humanities divide</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>218</bibl></note>. Assessing the current state of digital humanities scholarship, Brown argues that <q>it will be a major and crucial undertaking to imbue technical systems for the humanities with sensitivity to the complexities of language and discourse, an undertaking in which humanists need to be involved</q><note place="inline"><bibl>218</bibl></note>. The final phrase of that sentence underscores both the urgent need for humanists to engage in digital scholarship and their reluctance to do so. Brown adds, <q>Since digital modes of scholarly production are highly experimental, working at the interface of the digital-humanities divide constitutes, in itself, research, provided that the two aspects of the research seriously engage with one another. <ref target="#canon_formation">This includes archival development, creating generalized digital tools for access or analysis, or developing new pedagogies or critical literacies</ref></q> <note place="inline"><bibl>218</bibl></note>.</ref></ref> Brown’s statement is conditional: if humanists and computer scientists <q>seriously engage with one another,</q> then work at the interface/divide will be <q>highly experimental</q> and will constitute research in itself.</p>

                            <ref target="#technology">This conditional statement is key: serious engagement at the interface/divide of digital humanities is as difficult as it is important. Why? <ref target="#intertextuality">Because the digital humanities discipline is literally—if not for the work of Mary Louise Pratt—what one might term a <q>contact zone,</q> a many layered, conflicted, and overdetermined <q>pressure point</q> between the humanities and the sciences. Pratt’s term, developed in an analysis of colonial relations, is admittedly out of place here; what is more, it has been redeployed in so many different contexts, and used so frequently, that it has lost both specificity and analytical purchase.<note xml:id="n43" place="end">Mary Louise Pratt’s concept of contact zones gained currency less through her book <title level="m">Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation</title> than through her essay <title level="a">Arts of the Contact Zone,</title> published in <title level="j">Profession</title> <note place="inline"><bibl>New York: <abbr>MLA</abbr></bibl></note> in advance of the book. The article focuses on writing and literacy.</note> In <title level="m">Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation</title> <note place="inline"><bibl>1992</bibl></note>, Pratt defines contact zones as <q>social spaces where disparate cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in highly asymmetrical relations of domination and subordination—like colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out across the globe today</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>4</bibl></note>. Although the humanities and sciences are <q>disparate cultures</q> that <q>meet, clash, and grapple with each other,</q> comparing that struggle with <q>colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths</q> is certainly questionable.

When we began work on the project charter, <abbr>EMiC UA</abbr> consisted of nine researchers: two tenured faculty members, Paul Hjartarson and Harvey Quamen; an archivist, Raymond Frogner; and six graduate students, five in English—Rebecca Blakey, Kristin Fast, Andrea Hasenbank, Hannah McGregor, and Nick van Orden—and one, Matt Bouchard, in information studies.

Although most <abbr>EMiC UA</abbr> members are based at the University of Alberta, Raymond Frogner works in the Archives, Collections and Knowledge Division, BC Archives in Victoria, and Matt Bouchard is a doctoral student at the University of Toronto.

Once our proposal was accepted, our three-person group met regularly—approximately once a week over the summer—to push our thinking on these issues. <ref target="#technology">Developing a viable model of collaboration across the digital divide, a model that integrates mentoring into the collaboratory, we believe, is vital not just for our own work but for digital humanities projects generally. What rules of engagement might make collaboration and mentoring possible? Other members of <abbr>EMiC UA</abbr> joined us from time to time—as a break from scanning, to offer other perspectives on the matters at hand, or simply out of curiosity—and we reported on our work at regular meetings. In the weeks leading up to the conference, we devoted two regular <abbr>EMiC UA</abbr> meetings to debate project charter issues. Given the range of issues a project charter needs to address—from the nature of collaboration itself and the need for documentation to transparency in decision making and what we have tentatively termed <q>play nice</q> principles—we decided to focus the Ryerson iteration of our charter on what we term the <q>trust</q> cluster of principles: collaboration, credit, communication, and documentation.</ref></ref>

Collaboration is not a component of graduate research programs—students cannot, for example, collaboratively complete master’s or doctoral theses—and the humanities, unlike the sciences, have yet to develop widely recognized protocols for evaluating conference presentations, articles, or books produced by multiple authors. If, however, research is inter- or multidisciplinary, collaboration is, or perhaps should be, the preferred model. Moreover, if that research is conducted at the digital humanities interface, it is necessarily collaborative.</ref>

One way to achieve collective ownership is through the practice of pair programming—the coding equivalent of collaborative writing. Two team members sit down at the same computer, sharing the job of writing the day’s computer code. They pass the keyboard back and forth between themselves, taking turns writing and thinking and designing. The concept of the team supplants that of the individual; the group trumps the solo author. If one team member believes that a particular programming strategy is neither correct nor desirable, then the pair must find a mutually satisfying solution. <q>Collective code ownership requires teamwork</q> is the mantra. <q>Pair programming makes two people responsible for each line of code in the system, increasing the sense of team ownership</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Chromatic, section 6.3</bibl></note>.

Martin articulates the mismatch between author and audience that is all too familiar to humanists. He is wrestling with the polysemous nature of language (that is, code). And humanists might read in Martin’s screed a number of other interesting theoretical maneuvers: that documentation serves as the Derridean <q>dangerous supplement</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Derrida 158</bibl></note> to language’s inadequacy, that it is the suturing of a cognitive rift, that it is a second attempt at ideological interpellation.</ref>

Documentation is not the problem: it is both a solution and an opportunity. Digital humanists, increasingly working at the level of code, might not actually have the requisite literacy that Martin assumes is present in his programming teams. <ref target="#writing_climate">Brown’s observation that <q>working at the interface of the digital-humanities divide</q> is productive <q>providing that the two aspects of the research seriously engage with one another</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>218</bibl></note> means, for us, that humanists cannot sustain long-term <abbr>DH</abbr> projects if they refuse to engage—or even to learn anything at all about—topics like computer programming, markup languages, or interface design. Conversely, programmers cannot sustain <abbr>DH</abbr> projects in the long term without either taking the concerns of humanists seriously or understanding how and why humanities scholarship develops as it does. Altering practices on both sides of the divide might be the foundation that makes sustainable <abbr>DH</abbr> work possible.</ref> For example, Martin cites a few snippets of Java code and asks an intriguing question, but one that he sees as an either/or dichotomy</ref></ref>:</p>

Documentation is an information interchange, not compensation for failure. Documentation is shared culture. As <abbr>DHers</abbr>, we need not only to promote code literacy on the part of our humanist colleagues but also to encourage an understanding of humanist scholarship on the part of programmers. If documentation, as Martin insists, marks the failure of intent to match expression, then shared practices about documentation and discussions about the values that they embody might be the best way not to mind—that is, to mend—the gap between the digital and the humanities. Martin’s caveats remind us about the various kinds of documentation that digital humanities projects need to generate and the different audiences for whom those documents are intended. Well-written internal documentation, for example, should assist new team members by providing the record of a project’s history and its evolution (<q>The team changes. The team members change,</q> reflects <note place="inline"><bibl>Beck [11]</bibl></note>) Code comments included for reasons that are legal, clarifying, informative, or expressive of some kind of incomplete intent are wholly worthwhile, Martin maintains.

Linda Hutcheon and Michael Hutcheon’s article <title level="a">A Convenience of Marriage: Collaboration and Interdisciplinarity,</title> for example, documents the experience of working collaboratively as married colleagues across disparate fields. When their research necessitated a further reach of knowledge and experience, they extended this collaboration to a group of four graduate students.

Perhaps we will always have more questions. Perhaps it is the dialogue itself—the ongoing discussions regarding the project charter as an enabling form of communication among members of the group—that is important. Certainly, communication plays a significant role in the trust cluster as we have been mapping it. At some point in our work together, we realized that collaboration and credit are the key issues we need to address if we are to sustain our work together over the long term. Those two principles, we also began to realize, are forces held in uneasy tension. As one group member put it, the more one invests in collaboration within the humanities, particularly as a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, contract faculty, or emerging scholar, the more one is made aware of the need for the academic currency of individual credit. Prioritizing individual credit, however, can leave a researcher wanting the advantages of collaboration, the risks notwithstanding, and prompt her to undertake more collaborative work. Collaboration and credit function as two poles dominating and shaping the field in which we work, and the result is a constant flux of attraction and repulsion. Between these poles, we hold on to documentation and communication as ways of tracking the movements and relationships within our collaboratory, of balancing this dynamic, and propelling our work forward.</ref>

Kristin Fast, Andrea Hasenbank, and Paul Hjartarson took the lead in developing the Editing Modernism in Canada University of Alberta (<abbr>EMiC UA</abbr>) project charter and in writing the paper presented at the <abbr>CWRC</abbr> conference held at Ryerson University in October 2011. At one time or another, most members of <abbr>EMiC UA</abbr>, including Matt Bouchard, Harvey Quamen, Joseph McKinnon, and Charlotte Nobles, participated in our meetings, and all members, including Hannah McGregor, discussed both the charter and the draft prior to its presentation at Ryerson. Andrea Hasenbank, Paul Hjartarson, Vanessa Lent, and Harvey Quamen took the lead in revising both the paper and the project charter for publication. We would also like to acknowledge the invaluable advice offered by Lynne Siemens of the University of Victoria and Stan Ruecker of the <abbr>IIT</abbr> Institute of Design in Chicago, and the support of Dean Irvine, director of <abbr>EMiC</abbr>, and Susan Brown, director of <abbr>CWRC</abbr>. The shortcomings of this chapter, however, are entirely our own.</ref></ref></p>

This, in itself, was not surprising; as Nestruck observed, <q>in the country’s theatre ecology, second productions have always been harder to get than first productions…And revivals of older plays? For a long while, they were even rarer</q> (<title level="a">Canadian Revivals</title>). <ref target="#methodology">What was surprising was the intervention of Soulpepper’s productions into the traditional construction of the Canadian theatrical canon as a body of printed, rather than performed, works. In a gesture that we argue demonstrates what Ric Knowles has called a materialist-semiotic approach to theatre, Soulpepper publicized its revivals as re-presenting important past performances, rather than re-producing important published works.<note xml:id="n100" place="end"><ref target="#canon_formation">Ric Knowles, in his analysis of the establishment of the English-Canadian canon, confirms the historical contexts that shape Nestruck’s assertion: <q>before 1980 few Canadian scripts received a second production</q> <bibl>Knowles, <title level="a">Voices (Off)</title> 91</bibl>. <ref target="#anthologizaton"><ref target="#editions">Knowles suggests that the <q>quixotic and unpredictable</q> nature of the Canadian dramatic environment <bibl><title level="a">Voices (Off)</title> 91</bibl> led to the development of three <q>national anthologies</q> that sought to stabilize the dramatic canon.

All three versions of the play (1984, 1985, and 2011) begin with accounts of Cape’s attempted suicide. <ref target="#textual_agency">In the 1984 production, however, Cape reported his suicide attempt in a direct address to the audience that was significantly longer than the first published version of 1985; and, in 2011, the sequence was cut and altered so that Cape turned to the audience later and the exchange between Cape and the dog was enacted instead of reported. This alteration signalled that the 2011 production defined reality (or unreality, as Palk and Poddubiuk might put it) differently from the 1984 production and from the 1985 edition. In 1984, when eye contact and direct communication between character and audience was established immediately and the conversation with the dog was reported, the audience might have believed that the play-world operated according to the same rules as ordinary reality, and that Cape had imagined the dog; the 1985 text implied this same effect in fewer words. In 2011, however, Cape did not begin in direct address, and the dog spoke for itself. Immediately, the rules of the play-world (where dogs could speak) were significantly different from the rules of ordinary reality. But, when Cape turned to address the audience directly and viewers were suddenly defined as occupants of his unreal world, the ordinary reality the audience thought it occupied became as susceptible to redefinition as the play-world. If Cape could see the audience and viewers could see him and hear the dog, then either their sanity was as much in question as Cape’s or all reality—fictional and non-fictional—was radically perceptual. This significant development in the performance <q>text,</q> which relied on contrasting manipulations of space between productions—at times within a single production—is entirely occluded by the print transmission of the script. <ref target="#methodology"><ref target="#technology">In contrast, since materialist-semiotic visualization tools permit users to organize space and time as well as the written word, <abbr>SET</abbr> can illustrate the ways in which the 1984 and 2011 productions constructed the materialist-semiotic performance <q>text</q> differently to define on- and off-stage realities (see figures 3.6, 3.7a, and 3.7b)</ref></ref>. <note place="inline"><bibl>See also our comments on this sequence in Roberts-Smith et al., <title level="a">Visualizing Theatre Historiography</title>.</bibl></note></ref></ref></ref></ref>

Indeed, to talk of the Canadian canon today is to discuss a <q>transhistorical textual community</q> that many might assert is necessarily obsolete in the wake of our acknowledgement that <q>texts do not have a single, authoritative meaning, however much the established spokesmen for the canon at any given moment may claim that is the case</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Alter 5</bibl></note>. <ref target="#response_formal"><ref target="#genre_performance">Despite these theoretical advances, the critical responses to Soulpepper’s productions of both <title level="m">Fronteras Americanas</title> and <title level="m">White Biting Dog</title> confirm that canonicity—an idea with lingering resonance—arguably could be used to discredit the worth of historical performance traditions when they no longer speak to current arbiters of taste</ref></ref>. <ref target="#archive"><ref target="#technology"><ref target="#textual_agency">Rather than deny the value of printed texts that undoubtedly have affected the collective memory of theatregoers, we propose that <abbr>SET</abbr> can assemble various performance texts, visualize the ways they constitute meaning, and potentially analyze those materials as a corpus</ref>. We hope this kind of archive might facilitate an understanding of Canadian theatre as more than a <q>substantial body of proven plays,</q> as Salter has suggested was characteristic of Massey’s theatrical federalism <note place="inline"><bibl>82</bibl></note>. Rather, this corpus might visualize the synergies across a play’s production and reception histories as a vehicle for witnessing and experiencing the operations of nationhood that are, to quote Filewod again, <q>enacted in the imagined theatre</q> <note place="inline"><bibl><title level="m">Performing Canada</title> 1</bibl></note></ref></ref>.</ref>

Authors and publishers expect librarians to create metadata records that link a scholarly work to the host institution’s integrated library system (<abbr rend="small-caps">ils</abbr>), perhaps highlight the work as a <q>special item</q> in its online public access catalogue (<abbr rend="small-caps">opac</abbr>), and to link further to a library resource guide.</ref></ref>

The <abbr>ISTC</abbr> system not only enhances usage of the periodical, it also signifies semantic and other identities, as well as relationships between these identities. I close this chapter with suggestions for further research into the nature of digit­al work, including bibliographic versus ideational identification and the need to supply enriched metadata and proper identifiers so that readers can have comprehensive access to a work’s identity.</ref></ref>

In many cases, such as <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr>—an online infrastructure project designed to enable unprecedented avenues for digital studies in and about Canada—the platform hosts projects from Canadian universities in both official languages, English and French. Normalization of <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr>’s metadata likely would require the involvement of professional cataloguers who were willing compromisers. In fact, an international object identifying system, under which all contributors may register their content, would be a more efficient way to overcome metadata differences.</ref>

The stability of digital identifiers creates a foundation for the maintenance of reliable linking and traffic building and eases the management of copyright. <ref target="#genre">Often, for instance, securing copyright for digital scholarly editions is labour intensive—especially when dealing with older materials—and necessitates a management system at the site level to guarantee that all materials destined for online undergo the proper copyright clearance process.</ref> Moreover, digital identifiers make it easy to cite a work (regardless of its physical home) and serve as a version control (if it is assigned a checksum function). Digital identifiers employ a system of bibliographic identification that allows object identifiers to resolve dynamically into the correct <abbr>URL</abbr> as materials move. Thus, internal construction on the hosting platform should not affect the discoverability of the objects across the web, even in cases where they have been physically dis- or re-located.</ref>

An international system of identification, then, is a way to ensure preservation. For instance, if <abbr xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CWRC</abbr>’s infrastructure is a project’s home, then registering the works of the project through an international system of <abbr>DOI</abbr>s with an external agency would be a major step towards preservation by ensuring consistency of the digital object identity, format, and size. While the <abbr>DOI</abbr> would have no connection with the actual content of the work, it can and should testify to the integrity of the files. Thus, an identifier’s meaning is what Matthew G. Kirschenbaum and his co-authors define as <q>a further layer of computational abstraction that we can leverage against the first in order to reach a more informed evaluation about the state of the digital materials in question</q> <note place="inline"><bibl> 8</bibl></note>. Indeed, persistence is synonymous with future interoperability. In other words, any data put online should be able to identify a work, its creator, and its content, and provide a means to access it or some service about it both in the present and future <note place="inline"><bibl>Paskin, <title level="a">Digital Object</title> 101</bibl></note>. Further, in the case of works under copyright or some sort of digital rights management restrictions, identifiers and metadata are of paramount importance. The <abbr>DOI</abbr> would name the object and identify it as a unique entity, while metadata would describe the concept of the object. Assigned to objects of intellectual property, these identifiers would enable connections to be denoted on intellectual and physical levels <note place="inline"><bibl>Paskin, <title level="a">Components</title></bibl></note>.</ref>

The failure of the old <abbr>ISBN</abbr> system to keep up with the multiple conversions that occur during the distribution of present-day titles makes its reception and survival vulnerable. Separate <abbr>ISBN</abbr>s do facilitate the discoverability of various file formats and resolve digital rights management issues, but they do not link different versions of an e-book title. Currently, to avoid fragmentation, publishers count on libraries and electronic platforms to employ internal work identifiers or an <abbr>ISBN</abbr> database to match and link the various forms of a given work. Interoperability is limited, however, and identifiers and databases do not enable cross-platform discoverability. In fact, in its present state the <abbr>ISBN</abbr> identifier of e-books actually impedes content: if an <abbr>ISBN</abbr> does not identify different versions and editions of books, then an understanding of the life cycle of a book—from print to digital, and from digital to various digital packages and formats—is unavailable. If that life cycle is not available to readers, the book’s identification is unavailable as well.</ref>

Whereas an <abbr>ISBN</abbr> provides a unique identity in the supply chain for each product format, either as a physical product (a hardback or paperback) or digital product or format (a downloadable audiobook or <abbr>PDF</abbr> e-book), an <abbr>ISTC</abbr> identifies the underlying creative textual work and the discrete results of creative and/or intellectual effort expressed as text.

Graphic versions of novels, comics, cartoons, and manga are eligible, but the <abbr>ISTC</abbr> identifies only the textual element of these works, not the images.</ref>

The dismissal of advertisements as insignificant has resulted in the removal of advertisements from some modernist literary periodicals during the process of library rebinding. That incision prevents today’s readers from accessing the vast bibliographical knowledge that positions the literary work as a historicized object, as well as an aesthetic one.</ref> For instance, book advertising has changed over time and advertisements show how publishers viewed books in previous decades. Were those publishers selling books as physical objects? The content of books? The emotional experience of reading? Advertisements also act as gateways to the network of publishers, editors, typesetters, and advertising agencies associated with Canadian book publishing. Further, by modifying the original context in which a literary text was read, the work’s social dimensions are lost, the reading event—as well as the reader’s interpretation of the text—altered. <ref target="#authorship">The careers of many Canadian writers began in Canadian periodicals, for example, and advertisements that shared layout with short stories and poems have a bearing on the work, its evolution, and its life span. In fact, the digitization of the <title level="j">Canadian Bookman</title>—with a strong research emphasis on the juxtaposition of early literary works alongside advertisements—could reframe the reading event and influence anew the interpretation of literary texts.</ref></ref>

One must ask, for example, whether these scanned versions should be registered as the original work. There is no easy answer to this probing question. If paratexts inform the work—as I believe they do—scanning and presenting on the web only those periodical issues that are free of copyright shifts the work away from its original, print-based state. But in what way has the periodical been derived from the original? Is it in a manner that justifies a different identifier? Does <q>original</q> refer to an individual issue (or the texts within that issue) or the complete run of <title level="j">Canadian Bookman</title>? This matter is complicated further by the fact that a significant amount of content in the full run has Canadian copyright issues that may prevent its inclusion in the final digital edition. Moreover, serials differ from monographs, and one may wonder whether separate registration of each issue accurately reflects the intention of its editors (both the editors of the original print run and the current digitization). In other words, how a work is divided and identified has much to do with editorial considerations and not only with the management of digital content.</ref>

Monmonier examines the complex rhetoric of contemporary mapmaking in the age of print journalism and pre-web mass media.</ref> <ref target="#technology">His book provides a cautionary tour through the variety of expressive approaches that cartographers and the designers of geospatial infographics were using on the cusp—but not quite the bloom—of interactive digital mapping. In essence, it is a survey of print-based designs that produce geospatial un-truths in exactly those situations where truth is implied or expected.</ref> In other words, Monmonier looks at mappy, newsprint versions of a progression Mark Twain is said to have named <q>lies, damned lies, and statistics.</q></ref>

That is because we approach most geospatial visualizations with two strong assumptions that contribute to the power and supposed (strangely unquestioned) universality of digital mapping. The first assumption is that—unless otherwise explicitly signalled as fiction, farce, or allegory—solid, real-world referents underlie everything we see in maps. The second is that certain uniformities of scale and symbology exist within a single map—that is, cartographers maintain reasonable continuities in the relation of design to reality. Mapping embeds the tacit promise that <q>you are here</q> means something practical, and that the rules of any game of representation will never be changed in the middle of a street grid.</ref>

I intend to interrogate the bases of digital mapping and of engagement with geospatial information tools and systems (that is, with analytical <abbr>GIS</abbr>) as we have received those technologies from the sciences, and from more mimetic disciplines like landscape architecture and urban planning. Further, I hope to encourage and enable digital humanists to play with maps. By implication, that means to toy with (and maybe even subvert) established technological systems of production and dissemination of digital maps. Those twinned areas of praxis and inquiry, for my purposes, require much attention and work—and there is no denying that play elicits humanists’ best work.</ref> <ref target="#manuscript_history"><ref target="#childhood">At the heart of this essay is a set of historical maps by a fourteen-year-old girl from 1820s New England.

We carry live links to global positioning systems in our pockets and embed them in our cars, we consult slippy maps on touchscreens before stepping outside for a walk, and we are coming to expect to be able to sort digital search results spatially and to access historical and real-time location information for a wide variety of data. If a particular datum can be mapped, we often feel annoyed when it has not yet been mapped. And although the spatial technologies of everyday life fuel some of our expectations (technologies like networked transportation and social media tools), it now seems obvious to us that mappable data points include more than busses and trains, family and friends, and related objects of our stalker-like affection.</ref>

                                        <ref target="#education">A first step for the Scholars’ Lab is to establish the following: humanities scholars should not consider cartographic and geospatial technologies only through the lens of more obviously <abbr>GIS</abbr>-able disciplines like anthropology and archaeology, or area studies, urban planning, and environmental history. These fields have adopted existing spatial data, tools, and methods—and they have, to varying degrees, either made their peace or already negotiated terms of compromise with a set of limitations and assumptions they have inherited from the sciences. These are assumptions that circumscribe and, from the point of view of literary scholars, may even circumvent the expressiveness of geographic information systems.</ref>

                                <ref target="#spatiality">To question these assumptions is not to dismiss the fascinating work that is already unfolding when humanities scholars apply established <abbr>GIS</abbr> techniques to their research problems. <ref target="#authorship">Currently, for example, we are collaborating with University of Virginia classicist Jenny Strauss Clay and two of her graduate students. These scholars are letting Homeric verse drive a <abbr>GIS</abbr> analysis to determine feasible routes for travel—by mule—through the terrain of ancient Greece. The project tests Strauss’s theory that Homer’s catalogue of ships is ordered mnemonically as three distinct and real <q>itineraries</q> that would be familiar and memorable to listeners and bards. To that end, the Scholars’ Lab is applying a specific <abbr>GIS</abbr> technique called least-cost-path analysis, used primarily by governments to lay out highways.</ref> The project itself is potentially groundbreaking: it promises not only to elucidate the relationship between orally transmitted verse and real-world geographies, but—if distinct sequences are truly evident—to reveal the locations of lost archaeological sites <note place="inline"><bibl>Clay</bibl></note>. But its <abbr>GIS</abbr> methods, in themselves, are not strictly innovative. The story so far of <abbr>GIS</abbr> in the humanities is less about transformation and experimentation than about one-way adoption of technologies devised for other disciplines. Why is that?</ref>

                            <ref target="#spatiality">First, we must acknowledge what has been holding humanists back. In 2008, Martyn Jessop of King’s College, London published an article in <title level="j">Literary and Linguistic Computing</title> in which he documented what he called an unexpected <title>inhibition</title> among digital humanities scholars—a reluctance to engage deeply with geospatial tools and data <note place="inline"><bibl>Jessop 39</bibl></note>. <ref target="#education">In this piece, Jessop identifies the chief deficiencies of <abbr>GIS</abbr>es, from the point of view of the humanities, and he addresses the institutional systems that fail to support and promote their use. He notes that digital humanists are deeply engaged with place and space, and not usually daunted by a learning curve; they are, however, hesitant to embrace <abbr>GIS</abbr>.</ref> This article raises a fundamental question: Why—given the huge blossoming of activity elsewhere in <abbr>GIS</abbr>, the deep engagement of the humanities with place and space, and the general technological adventurousness of the digital humanities community—have scholars in our field been so slow to engage with maps?</ref>

The first and <q>most fundamental</q> addresses the very place of visualization and work with images in the discourse-based research methodology of the humanities. <ref target="#intellectual_history"><ref target="#education">We were never taught (and therefore we are not teaching our graduate students) how to read and create images—much less how to engage intelligently with cartographic representation, old or new. This is a widely recognized (if seldom addressed) issue in humanities research training, particularly in the fields of literature and history. <ref target="#technology">But less frequently do we address the problem of cartographic awareness in the context of new possibilities afforded to literary scholarship by digital mapping.</ref></ref></ref></ref>

                                <ref target="#theme_or_topic">The next two reasons involve <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools and the data to which we as humanities scholars want to apply those tools. How suitable are current geospatial software packages to the concerns of the humanities, since this software is made and marketed almost entirely within the sciences and quantitative social sciences? <ref target="#history">Production and reception histories of texts—that is, the history of printing and publishing, the histories of readership—may be reasonably mappable, but, as we know, such bibliographical scholarship is still marginalized in the broader discipline of literary studies.</ref> How useful, then, are <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools to the interpretive concerns of the majority of literary scholars? How apt are they at reflecting or analyzing the spatial relations of qualities like subjectivity and emotion? Can <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools be used to analyze time as it is experienced and expressed in narrative—how do they deal with the complex chronologies we see every day in the documentary record? The answer is <q>not very well.</q> <ref target="#economics">In fact, it is only recently that time became a factor at all in the geospatial software produced by California-based Environmental Systems Research Institute, a company that controls the market for analytical <abbr>GIS</abbr></ref>.</ref>

Typical <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools are geared toward synchronic analysis of incredibly dense data sets, but humanists tend to analyze sparser data, leading to understandings that play out diachronically over time. More importantly for literary scholars, <abbr>GIS</abbr> software has been designed to filter out uncertainty and ambiguity. It is built to smooth away wrinkles—to remove their traces as aberrations that are probably accidental, on the way to resolving larger data trends. <abbr>GIS</abbr> software does not celebrate, highlight, or dwell in ambiguity.</ref>

One might expect that our uses of <abbr>GIS</abbr>, since Jessop’s 2008 article, would have become increasingly ludic and experimental. But Ian Gregory and Paul Ell suggest otherwise in their 2007 book, <title level="m">Historical <abbr>GIS</abbr>: Technologies, Methodologies, and Scholarship</title>. Gregory and Ell state that <q>the researcher using <abbr>GIS</abbr> should be asking, <q>What are the geographical aspects of my research question?</q> rather than [the more open] <q>What can I do with my dataset using this software?</q></q> <note place="inline"><bibl>1</bibl></note>, opening their treatment in a manner far too proscriptive for my purposes. Such an approach will be highly effective in applying <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools to the precise purposes for which they were designed, but I find it unnecessarily limiting with respect to experimental visualization practices in fields like literary and textual studies.</ref>

Second, there is a fundamental mismatch between our research questions, data, and expectations, and those for which <abbr>GIS</abbr> software was designed. As a result, we keep telling ourselves, in what may be a self-defeating way, that in order to use spatial tools and methods we should behave more like scientists. Finally, prevailing institutional structures have neither rewarded nor helped to sustain research in the field of digital humanities.</ref>

The notion of drawing as a way of thinking—what Johanna Drucker has called <q>graphesis</q> or knowledge building through iterative graphical expression—may help energize and shape a literary <abbr>GIS</abbr> suitable for humanities research <note place="inline"><bibl>Drucker 133–36</bibl></note>. It might aid us in asserting a role for cartographic design in humanities exegesis, and help us bring spatial approaches and software systems into productive tension with the aims and customs of interpretive (as well as strictly analytical) place-based research. Maps, as literary scholars will want to read and produce them, operate somewhere (perhaps everywhere) on the playful spectrum of lies, damned lies, and statistics. I view this not as something to caution against, de-bug, and filter away, but to enable—particularly if we want to see a locally appropriate upswell of creative and scholarly engagement in the spatial humanities, complementing the use of geographical information in other disciplines and industries.</ref>

Even within a framework that tacitly assumes a one-to-one correspondence between representation and real landscape, we can license ourselves to lie—experimentally, playfully, procedurally, and productively.

They sketched maps of spaces and places well known to them—their homes, schools, villages, and towns—from which they could work outward. Eventually, with the aid of textbooks and atlases, they moved from local representation to the national and international scene. Crucial to this lesson (and to my understanding of the graphetic possibilities for spatial humanities research) was the persistence of the basic exercise Willard taught: to create graphical visualizations as an aid to developing geospatial memory.</ref>

Near the panhandle appear interesting incongruities—fictions, actually—between political boundaries and watersheds. It is tempting to read an unresolved tension between two conceptual layers or dimensions, as represented on the single plane of Henshaw’s map.</ref> <ref target="#technology">If she had been limited to modern <abbr>GIS</abbr> tools, Henshaw would have been forced to disambiguate her representation into layers, exposing a tension between informational and aesthetic structures in maps that textual scholars would recognize as the longstanding issue of <q>overlapping hierarchies</q> in the work of the Text Encoding Initiative (Renear, Mylonas, and Durand).</ref></ref></p>

Recall her cardinal directions, which place north at the top margin and west in the gutter of each recto leaf. They are augmented by labels for bounding states and bodies of water: <q>Bounded North by Massachusetts,</q> <q>south by the Atlantick,</q> and so forth. These cardinal directions hold true across every one of the nineteen texts, even in cases like Virginia, where the shape of the corresponding map prompts Henshaw to choose a landscape orientation for the page. <ref target="#tone_or_style">In the text that corresponds with her Virginia map, she offers a fairly unpoetic and disjointed selection of passages from <title level="m">Geography Made Easy</title>—capping the penmanship exercise with an elaborate ornamental cherub holding a sweeping ribbon or banner inscribed <q>Virginia.</q> But the cherub occupies the <q>northern</q> field of her page, so Henshaw is unable to position the expected <q>North by <hi rend="small-caps">maryland</hi></q> label appropriately. In other words, the aesthetic force of the textual ornament trumps Henshaw’s own conventions of directionality. Maryland is displaced to the west—where it crowds Kentucky toward the south, into a position where one might now seek, and fail to find, Tennessee.</ref></ref>

                            <ref target="#spatiality">The map version of Henshaw’s <q>Ohio</q> is equally interesting as a study in interpretive selectivity. Two aspects of the map stand out. <ref target="#methodology">First, it appears that Henshaw may have used conflicting atlases as source images. <ref target="#education">Second, this map, above all others I have examined, seems to bear traces of a pedagogical practice, perhaps inspired by Willard’s teaching style, which otherwise might have been lost to us. I posit that someone, in all likelihood a schoolmistress, read aloud a geography textbook and directed Henshaw and her fellow students to make imaginative placements of voiced elements on the sketched maps before them. After tracing the basic contours of the map of Ohio, Henshaw sought to position forts and internal boundary lines based on descriptive prose she heard read aloud.</ref> Evidence of this is borne in the selection and placement of elements on the map, but her embedded texts also bear traces of the aural. The city of Cincinnati is spelled <q>Cincinata.</q> There is a town Henshaw labels as <q>Nassauville</q> which every source spells <q>Masseyville.</q> Many futile attempts to corroborate Henshaw’s spelling in text and map archives have led me to conclude that her map of Ohio bears evidence of mishearing. <ref target="#technology">This is perhaps a minor point, but it demonstrates how much we may be able to learn from a close and computer-assisted reading of historical maps.</ref></ref></ref>

They pertain to geospatial editing in the two guises in which we understand all textual production and editorial and scholarly work—that is, with representation on the one hand, and generation on the other. First, representation. The question here is how to represent the intertwined cartographic and textual condition that is foregrounded in a project like Henshaw’s, but is actually evident in every atlas or map that we find incorporated into a printed or manuscript book. How might we, as scholarly editors, approach all the maps and geospatial data we either have been ignoring or, for decades, been treating like illustrations rather than the embedded geospatial information systems they are?</ref>

                            <ref target="#spatiality">The question about generation is meant to be both merry and pragmatic, a balance I deem especially important in digital humanities scholarship. First, I wish to know how to create interpretive environments (sets of toys as much as tools) that will allow humanists to play with geographic expression—how, for instance, to incorporate cartographic sketching practices within our hermeneutic tool kit. Finally, I want to know how to make new digital mapping environments so naturally joyful to use that humanities scholars will see clearly that these tools are, indeed, toys.</ref>

Many of us are now reflecting on how we accomplish these things while on mobile digital devices and Global Positioning System (<abbr>GPS</abbr>)–enabled maps.

Entire neighbourhoods spring up from the ground in a matter of weeks; large downtown areas are reconceived and rebranded through ambitious projects. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, Canadian cities like Edmonton, for example, have been made infamous by such spectacle. This is a unique period in the history of urban development</ref>. <ref target="#writing_climate">From the perspective of the everyday, individual life, it might very well be an untold experience. As a postwar, mid-sized, car-centred city, Edmonton is at once unique and a representative case study. It is unique in that it is North America’s most northern city of over one million inhabitants, but it is also representative of the main type of urban space—based on mobility—that developed after the <ref target="#history">Second World War</ref>. Such cities have been either understudied or dismissed as characterless manifestations of <q>sprawl.</q> It is precisely this lack of attention that animates this project. This is starting to change, with books by Linda Goyette, Darrin Hagen, and my own beginning to chronicle Edmonton. But it is still possible to pick up a book subtitled <title level="m" type="sub">Writing Canadian Cities</title> and see no mention of Edmonton. Far from a detriment, however, being understoried is a boon to the Pipelines project, as it means the Edmonton city space is still malleable, amenable to a plethora of stories that intersect in complex ways. Any single city location might mean a number of things, and our various pipelines attempt to distribute distinct meanings through semiotically dense urban spaces.</ref></ref>

Parkour uses urban space against the grain, using city structures as a physical and orienteering challenge. And geocaching creates secret communities by hiding small objects in plain sight, unnoticed except by the online community swapping geolocations. These games, specific to cities, engender twenty-first-century urban subjectivities, less individualistic than those of the late nineteenth (flâneur) or twentieth centuries (psychogeography and the everyday), even though the forms of community they produce are fleeting and often accidental. Like their predecessors, Manhunt, parkour, and geocaching are technologically mediated.

                                <ref target="#technology">What the Rossdale collection will look like is still to be determined, but I want to close by speculating about digitizing ludic tropes for inhabiting the city. <ref target="#social movement">With regard to Manhunt, for example, is there something in the way players find and use spaces that do not appear on a map that might allow us to better tell stories? In a sense, Manhunt turns the specificities of GIS in on itself: one might geolocate an individual and still not see her. As I mention above, parkour quite explicitly uses urban space against the grain. Could we imitate parkour’s hard-body insistence on taking built environments as a challenge? What if we take the built environment (whether that is urban space or Google Earth imagery) not as a given but as a dare? As for geocaching, it creates secret communities, populating the city with secret caches we cavalierly bypass all the time. Unlike maps, which pretend to tell everything, a map that uses geocaching as its formative metaphor would pretend to tell nothing.</ref> But everything is there, under the surface. <ref target="#theme_or_topic">Urban meaning is precisely that: not inert, but actively formed by adopting a purposeful perspective, by looking carefully at places where others see nothing, following power lines and lost burial grounds to uncover something telling. Nowhere is this truer than in Edmonton, where the one thing most people accept is that there is nothing to see in the city.</ref></ref>

The collection has grown from its origins as a personal hobby, out of storage space in the homes of various members of <title level="j">The Body Politic</title> collective, to a large-scale research collection in need of workspace for archivists and researchers alike. In 1988, it moved to a 1,000-square-foot space on the second floor of 464 Yonge Street in Toronto. By 1992, the collection had grown so large it demanded a move to the archive’s first fully independent space—2,000 square feet at 56 Temperance Street in Toronto <note place="inline"><bibl><abbr>CLGA</abbr>, <title level="a">A Chronology of the Archives</title></bibl></note>. The collection eventually outgrew the space on Temperance Street and the archive moved to yet another location at the corner of Church and Wellesley Streets—the heart of Toronto’s historic gay village. In 2009, thanks to the work of former city councilor Kyle Rae and the generosity of the Children’s Aid Society of Toronto, the <abbr>CLGA</abbr> was able to acquire the Jared D. Sessions House, an Italianate heritage home built in 1858, and located at 34 Isabella Street in Toronto <note place="inline"><bibl><abbr>CLGA</abbr>, <title>Doors Open Script</title></bibl></note>. The house was envisaged as a public showcase for the vast amount of material amassed over the course of almost four decades. For the first time ever, the archive had a dedicated gallery.

It considers postcards, a technology of communication and of the circulation of images that took shape at the end of the nineteenth century, looking in particular at one crucial group in one category of early twentieth-century postcards—those bearing images of erotic dancers. My interest here is even more particular: this chapter focuses on postcard images of <ref target="#nationality">Canadian-born</ref> dancer Maud Allan in studio poses from what was, by 1908, her internationally known dance <title level="a">The Vision of Salome.</title> <ref target="#genre_performance"><ref target="#spatiality"><ref target="#health_issue">Allan’s Salome postcards, carrying the image of the dancer around the world and from the space of performance into the space of the home, or the domestic, are a foundational element in what the rhetoric of media representation suggests was a kind of disease: <q>Salomania,</q> the name for the condition of proliferating performances of Salome in the manner of Maud Allan, was a <q>condition</q> that mobilized in the early twentieth century what is now familiar as the rhetoric of the <q>viral.</q></ref> <ref target="#sexuality"><ref target="#gender_issue">Maud Allan’s Salome postcards, as I hope to demonstrate, are important as both analogous to and precursors for the digital sphere and in particular for the circulation of images of women that represents a crucial circuit for the web as an ideological apparatus and a structure for constituting gender and sexuality.</ref></ref> The <q>digital</q> is a cultural apparatus with histories in earlier technologies and practices of representation. By suggesting that postcards’ mobilization of images of women as erotic dancers anticipates and establishes a culture of the rapid circulation of images that women undertake to embody through imitation or what we might understand as corporeal mimesis (embodying the image), this chapter works toward an understanding of other <q>digital</q> histories.</ref></ref></ref>

In another register, the mobile female body is implicit and made spectacular in the fact of the performing woman who has travelled to appear on stage: Allan’s presence in front of the audience is evidence of her having come from elsewhere, of not being at home. <ref target="#language"><ref target="#nationality">Although this fact of mobility is implicit in every female performer’s appearance on stage, Allan again made it emphatic: her own ambiguous nationality—she was Canadian-born, American by her father’s naturalization, trained in Europe, and, increasingly following her success in England in 1908, British-accented, as some interviewers noted, with flashes of Americanism </ref><note xml:id="n83" place="end"><ref target="genre_journalism">See, for instance, an interview in the <title level="j">Chicago Tribune</title> on January 23, 1910, in which the interviewer notes that <q>[a] whole-souled eastern drawl seems all the time trying to break through the shell of an English veneer.

Allan’s papers and personal effects are concentrated in two locations. The first is Toronto’s Dance Collection Danse (<abbr>DCD</abbr>), a non-institutional repository of documents and materials related to dance history. In 1996, through a donation from her biographer Felix Cherniavsky, <abbr>DCD</abbr> acquired Allan’s papers, two of her own handmade Salome costumes, and some other objects. The <abbr>DCD</abbr> collection includes several postcards, some of which date from the early twentieth century and some of which are recent reproductions. The second major location of Allan’s papers is the Charles E. Young Research Library at University of California, Los Angeles (<abbr>UCLA</abbr>). The <abbr>UCLA</abbr> Library holds some of Allan’s books, photograph albums, some performance ephemera, a <q>letter book</q> containing carbon copies of letters written by her manager Angus MacLeod during a tour of India, Asia, and Australasia between 1913 and 1915 with the Cherniavsky Trio, and a postcard album containing cards Allan received and acquired, only some of which reproduce her image; many are records of visits and travel through Europe. Other collections of materials related to Allan (the San Francisco Performing Arts Library, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts) also include significant numbers of postcards.</ref>

In a copy of a 1913 letter in the <abbr>UCLA</abbr> letter book, for instance, Allan’s manager, MacLeod, writes to a company wishing to use her image:</ref></p> <q type="block"><ref target="#representation_of_women"><ref target="#economics">Miss Allan has no objection to your advertising your cigarettes in the way you propose</ref> + can supply you with a block but cannot undertake to distribute your post-cards…I will however give you a list of the places in India Miss Allan will visit &amp; you could forward the matter yourselves.

This postcard album also contains what appears to be a very early black and white postcard of Allan as Salome, before the idiom had been so well established in and through the proliferation of Salome postcards, and before her own name had come to be well known: the card, with a grainy photograph of Allan in her Salome costume, identifies her as <q>Miss Allan Maud.</q></ref>

Postcards, as the proliferation of Allan cards demonstrates, made it possible to capitalize on the image in ways that had not previously been possible. The image could be bought and sold; thus, while its work, as I am suggesting here, is importantly symbolic, the postcard also facilitated the emergence of the image as not simply the representation of the thing but the thing itself—or, as Jean-Luc Nancy suggests, of the image as <q>a thing that is not the thing [but] distinguishes itself from it</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>2</bibl></note>.

                                        <ref target="#theme_or_topic">Although postcard images of Allan circulated widely and were produced in Europe and North America as well as England, I am focusing here on England for two key reasons. <ref target="#class_issue">First, it was in England that Allan rose to spectacular fame, and where the picture postcard’s mobilization of her image can be seen to have had its most telling effect on her celebrity. <ref target="#historical_oppression"><ref target="#genre_journalism">Second, the postcard emerged in England as an imperial medium, a form of communication across the space of empire and a means of putting into circulation Anglo-Saxon presence in places outside of England—or, in effect, of affirming what Percival Pollard described in his <title level="j">New York Times</title> Salomania article of 1908 as <q>our Anglo-Saxon lands.</q> The British postcard’s imperial function is suggested in accounts of its beginnings. In <title level="m">The Picture Postcard and Its Origins</title>, Frank Staff cites a 1900 account of a deliberate decision on the part of the first publishers of <q>pictorial postcards</q> to <q>issue cards of a topical character, that is, having views or portraits of interest at the moment</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>89</bibl></note>.</ref> Thus, according to this record, the <q>first topical picture postcard [in England] was that illustrating the Nile Expedition of 1897. It bore portraits of [imperial heroes Charles George] Gordon and the since famous Sirdar, Lord Kitchener</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Staff 89</bibl></note>. The early turn to imperial events and portraiture suggests that, in England at least, the postcard was functionalized from its first appearance as a medium for carrying information across and about imperial space—that, indeed, it was a form of communication that operated precisely in the context of empire.</ref></ref></ref>

By 1900, as Tonie Holt and Valmai Holt note, picture postcards had become a regular form of communication. The Holts cite Margaret Mead, writing in the <title level="m">Girl’s Realm</title> in 1900: <q>The Picture Postcard,</q> Mead writes, <q>is with us. It suits us. It meets our needs</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>cover blurb</bibl></note>. These needs, Gillen and Hall suggest, can be understood to pertain to <q>quick, informal and attractive written messages</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>2</bibl></note> that could be sent and answered in multiple postal deliveries a day. In January 1902, Gillen and Hall further indicate, the British post office <q>gave in to popular demand and permitted the use of postcards on which one side was wholly taken up by an image, and the other side had half address and half message</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>2</bibl></note>. The space for the image, by then, exceeded that of the address and of the message, whose space was stipulated on many cards with statements such as <q>This space for communication only.</q></ref> If the communication was important, the image was no less a part of the circuit established in the transmission of the postcard from sender to recipient, and was certainly crucial to the rise of postcards as objects themselves.</ref>

The picture postcard is based, in part, on the earlier medium of the <hi rend="italic">carte de visite</hi>, itself an evolution of the calling card, with a photograph to identify the visitor. It also follows the emergence of commodity media such as the cabinet card and the cigarette card. The cabinet card emerged as a primary medium for portraits in the 1860s. The cigarette card was popularized in the 1880s as a means of stiffening soft cigarette packages. <ref target="#representation_of_women">Both media served as locations not only for personal portraiture to circulate among friends, but for the reproduction specifically of photographic images of women and, in particular, women dancers, actors, and burlesque performers, the latter often photographed wearing tights and closely fitting body suits, or, like the Salome images, in genital-defining, jewelled bra and torso filigree, and semi-transparent skirts. The images on these cards (especially the cigarette cards) are often identical or very close to those reproduced on postcards; hence, the shift from one commodity form to another at the fin de siècle makes sense.</ref></ref>

In this work, they operate to mobilize the image and to monetize it. They are things to buy that are also representing something that makes people want to purchase them for circulation. One Salome postcard in the <abbr>DCD</abbr> Maud Allan collection, postmarked December 1908, makes this point evident in its referencing on the back the image on the front. <q>How’s this of Maudie?</q> the sender asks. Walkowitz cites a postcard in the San Francisco Performing Arts Library that emphasizes not only the value of the circulating image as spectacle but specifically the collector’s interest in images of Allan: the sender writes of the photograph of Allan in her <q>Chopin’s Funeral March</q> costume, <q>Hope you haven’t got this p.c.

The calling card, in these terms, conveys a message akin to <q>I am here.</q></ref> It is also the case, however, that the postcard always references and represents what is absent—both the sender and the object. They <q>take the place of one’s self</q> when the self is not actually there. They are, as image, absent (marking, as Nancy suggests, <q>the absence of the thing</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>37</bibl></note>; thus, they function as a space to be filled in by the woman looking at the image and seeing herself through its imitation or replication on her own. In this way postcards’ <q>double logic</q> is doubled again, and the card, with its message that may say something like the classic <q>Wish you were here,</q> counters the image that says, in effect, <q>You are here.</q> At least, this is what it might be understood to say to women and girls bringing the image of Allan as Salome home and <q>matching</q> it in the <q>privacy of their abodes</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>Walkowitz 362</bibl></note></ref></ref>.</ref>

Allan’s Salome postcards constitute what we might regard as an archive of the mobile subject, representing as they do figures who are not <q>here,</q> women who are not at home but on the move and in public. <ref target="#economics">Thus, they not only index but constitute a growing economy of the image itself as the space and the <q>reality</q> that women inhabit. At once indexical of Allan’s own movement through and across national spaces and of the commerce of exchange in white female bodies that Allan incorporates foundationally into her Salome dance, postcards also function as a space where white femininity is staged, representing and standing in for the body that has been rendered as image. <ref target="#health_issue">That is, although the travels of the mobile body are central to Salomania, the <q>craze,</q> as it developed in 1908, proved to be not only or even primarily about the infected <hi rend="italic">body</hi>.</ref> What is materialized, what is in circulation, what is imitated and copied, what is reproduced, what proliferates, and what <q>goes viral</q> is the image of Allan as Salome</ref>: indeed, it is the image itself that is a key element in the rise of Salomania as a culture of imitation. <ref target="#race_issue"><title level="a">The Vision of Salome</title> put into circulation an image of mobile, fungible white femininity that lent itself to imitation and generated mimic performance because it was itself foundationally <q>pose.</q> Allan did not embody but staged white femininity, functionalizing the body itself as image and thus as the space for the performance of racialized gender in what we might best understand as corporeal mimesis, and thus making evident and overt the terms under which white femininity could be understood to circulate at the turn of the century.</ref></ref>

The Salomania of the early twentieth century is, I have undertaken to suggest, an effect of the rapid circulation of images in what was at that time the relatively new technology of postcards and, crucially, the mobilization of images of women that could move from public into domestic space, from body to image. <ref target="#genre_non_book_media">Postcards of erotic dancers and, in particular, Maud Allan’s Salome postcards, whose foundational importance to digital image culture is indicated in their reproduction and proliferation in digital media, are records of an earlier moment in the development of that culture; analogous to the digital circulation of images of women, they are also important precursors of that circulation.</ref></ref>

Since his success as a preacher masks a lack of true conviction, faith follows vocation. <ref target="#spatiality">He saunters under the direction of the purposive narrator who has a direct line into his perceptions.

For today’s reader many topographical references also highlight what has changed: department stores have disappeared; the <abbr>CBC</abbr> has a new gleaming location on Front Street West; and the Royal Ontario Museum now literally juts onto Bloor Street.</ref> What Irwin captures, I suggest, is a Toronto few of her millions of residents would recognize today. <ref target="#religion">The modern consciousness of her Torontonian protagonists has a distinctive theological and apologetic cast. Within the confessional debates and church interiors of her novels there is limited recognition of coeval others.</ref> Communication circuits involve a range of ethical and pedagogical topics. <ref target="#intertextuality">Rather than simply reifying her work as glimpses of a past, it is worth considering how they amplify and thicken our understanding of boom and growth. Moreover, rather than positioning Irwin as the baseline against which to measure the urban consciousness of Young, Gwendolyn MacEwen, or Margaret Atwood, it might be time to adjust and re-apply the criteria of the interplay of diversity and the multiplicity and openness of place to resuscitate awareness of the career of this independent, strong-minded individual of great, unswerving conviction. If interest exists in what Ricoeur labelled a horizon of expectations, which <q>tends toward the breaking open of perspectives</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>209</bibl></note>, then perhaps the understudied hermeneutic architecture of Irwin’s Toronto the Good warrants exploration.</ref></ref>

The little girl makes language <q>pass</q> across borders, she makes connections, she averts disaster. Is this how I glue the two halves of myself together?

I love the entry into so many different worlds where the speakers discuss their affairs as if they were alone. I love the lack of a safety net, the fact that the speaker moves on and you have to follow, no matter what. I find, though, that interpreters, although very interesting and congenial people, are too pragmatic about languages. They see them as tool kits, as means to an end, as little lexicons they prepare for each conference. They speak of <q>having</q> English or Spanish or Arabic as a working language, whereas I believe that if anything, language <q>has</q> us. Still, I love the movement between and among languages, and interpretation is an extreme form of that. Listening to words in one language and, with that half-sentence lag, spinning them into another. <q>How can you talk and listen at the same time?</q> is the question always asked by people who stop by our booth to say thank you. There is a switch on our console to change channels when you change languages, so that the listener does not receive the wrong one. Not so easy to flip that switch in your head.

In fact, otherness is everywhere; perhaps there is no such thing as sameness, though we convince ourselves for various reasons that there is. When our son was learning to talk, I remember teaching him: this is your hand. And this? he asked. Oh, that’s your other hand. He holds up one, then the other: my hand, my other hand. My other hand, my hand. It took him a long time to realize that if you start with the right hand, the <q>other hand</q> is the left, and vice versa. Otherness is a shifting property, and nothing makes that clearer than translation. The other text, the other words, the other that is language, the other in your <q>own</q> language, which you can never truly own. There are ways in which it will bend and others in which it will not, at least not without violence. Meeting the other text means confronting everything you know and do not know about <q>your</q> language and the <q>other</q> language. Both are yours, neither is yours.

That is the beauty of self-translation; you can do anything you like. We could certainly discuss whether this translation is good or bad, if it works or doesn’t work, but that is another issue.

In English, the equivalent (<q>and travel, and love</q>) does not sound like poetry to my ear. In fact, I take a definite turn towards narrative instead of lyricism. Another difference is that the English version is more optimistic (we learn sooner that she survived the affair with the married man and kept visiting Paris anyway) but also speaks from a different space and time, many years later (the French tells how she feels in the present). The English is less immediate and more elegiac; <q>she</q> is less lost, more experienced, and more of a survivor. <ref target="#spatiality">But I am saying all this from another space, the space of a literary critic, looking at it from outside, at the effect it produces; when recreating, I don’t think of it that way, I just follow the words where they take me, on blind faith.</ref></ref>

So there is real loss here, there is mourning. Self-translation is about loss, or maybe it’s about getting rid of things and finding something else instead. <ref target="#theory">And also the loss, I hope, can be offset at some other point—in translation theory this is referred to as <q>compensation.</q></ref> The final change, from <q>the man who would never leave his wife</q> to <q>this man she confused with fate,</q> is a major shift. I like this vague version, this image of her as confused (which refers back to the first passage and tells us, but at a different point in the text, about how lost she was then), this idea of fate not being where we thought it was: what we thought counted did not, and vice versa. <ref target="#language"><ref target="#translation">That difference in perspective corresponds, I think, not only to the differences between English and French but to the gap between the woman I was when I wrote the piece, years ago, and the woman I am now.

It is a sign of linguistic otherness, a slightly dissonant structure. The piece had to end with the mention of the fruit, which is the overall title and the thread that runs through the series of four poems. Here is something interesting: the word <q>love</q> has again done a disappearing act; is English really more puritanical, or is it just me? <ref target="#childhood">That upbringing I so longed to escape and which is still in my narrative voice?</ref> Things come back, life is full of cycles. I can accept that now, though earlier in my life it would not have been a joking matter. I like the parallel, which is added, with the word <q>open</q>: the <q>open bed</q> and the <q>open fruit.</q> In the middle of the piece is a lyrical description of the mangosteen, the bright red inside the brownish shell, and the bright white flesh inside. It is a metaphor of bodies, of desire. I think this parallel with the open bed and the open fruit offsets some of the loss of lyricism in the previous excerpt. I like the word <q>open</q> in this context and what it suggests about that confused, lost but vital young girl biting into the forbidden fruit—not an apple, not a pomegranate, but a mangosteen, losing the Eden of that particular passion but surviving to return to Paris over and over again and make it her own private garden. Is all that in the piece? Maybe not for an outside reader, though it is for me. And that is what I think I tried to put into those words.</ref>

But it also allows me to put them back together again. There are some things I would no longer say, years later—this piece is at least fifteen years old—and others I would say instead, and others I would still say, but differently (but of course if you say it differently you are no longer saying the same thing anyway). Languages are spaces and self-translation is a radical form of travel. I see the changes made as intrinsic to the languages I was writing in and into and suggest they be read not as discrepancies or mistakes but as signs of linguistic difference (although we could certainly discuss other choices that could have been made). Just as I feel both my languages to be my first or strongest and equally essential, I consider both versions of the prose poem originals.</ref>

Il arrivait d’un voyage d’affaires en Asie, elle de Montréal où ils habitaient tous deux. Paris était pour elle nouveau, et les voyages, et l’amour. D’Asie il lui a rapporté des mangoustans. Goûte, dit-il, tu vas voir. La chair est d’une vive blancheur, lovée dans une écorce rouge violent. Elle goûte le sucre et l’eau fraîche, le lointain et la source. La jeune femme ne connaissait ni le nom, ni le fruit. Elle était si jeune qu’elle croyait encore aller de voyage en voyage, de fruit en fruit, si jeune qu’elle était sûre de toujours voyager en compagnie du même homme, qui n’allait pourtant jamais quitter sa femme.

La magie peut être étonnante sans toutefois être considérée comme impossible à l’aune des croyances du contexte socioculturel. <ref target="#genre_novel"><ref target="#religion">Ainsi, dans <title level="m">Les enfants du sabbat</title>, on parle de possession et d’exorcisme (éléments significatifs du catholicisme), qui sont des préceptes religieux inscrits dans le réel de l’époque. En cela, ils ne relèvent pas du royaume de l’impossible. En particulier, pour les religieuses du couvent, le diable constitue une véritable menace. Comme le magique dans le réalisme magique, le diable n’est ni métaphorique, ni allégorique. Le roman place de ce fait sur un seul niveau tous les éléments du surnaturel, peu importe qu’ils soient sacrilèges ou sacrés. En réduisant la distance entre ces antipodes, on ouvre la voie à une critique, qui s’y faufile. Le sabbat illustre ce principe : le diable, une métamorphose du père de Julie, viole la jeune fille, et la description du viol est tout à fait ancrée dans le réel. L’acte <hi rend="italic" xml:lang="la-VA">horribilis</hi> est ponctué de latin (toujours en italique dans le texte), le <q><hi rend="italic" xml:lang="la-VA">ite missa est</hi></q> provenant de voix désincarnées</ref>. <ref target="#charactrization">Après l’acte sanglant et brutal, Sœur Julie se dévoile à son père, ayant été témoin du viol de sa jeune forme.

Son agresseur, son père, devra dès lors la servir. <ref target="#spatiality">L’espace temporel de cet accord est 1930</ref>. Toutefois, c’est en 1940 qu’une nonne du couvent, sœur Gemma, va être victime des tours de la sorcière Julie et de son père le diable. Ce passage illustre un nivellement pluridimensionnel qui résout de multiples antinomies sémantiques, typographiques, temporelles et spatiales. Pourrait-on dire alors que le Québec d’antan et le nouveau Québec sont mêlés dans ce brouillage thématique, temporel et spatial?

Que Julie soit sorcière n’est pas problématique puisque <q>(tout le monde sait que la sorcellerie est héréditaire)</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>108</bibl></note>, comme nous le rappelle le texte en employant une formule qui banalise cet effet généalogique en plaçant entre parenthèses la remarque qui vise à souligner la nature évidente de la sorcellerie. La généalogie est présente dans le code du réel du roman par le truchement d’événements surnaturels. La sorcellerie est introduite de façon <q>nonchalante</q> (tel l’ange aux ailes immenses de Marquez) à l’aide de remarques triviales. Dans <title level="m">Les enfants du sabbat</title> s’entremêlent alors histoire, biologie et sorcellerie. <ref target="#history">Je voudrais surtout souligner ici la référence à l’histoire québécoise à l’aide de personnages non fictionnels, comme Barbe Hallé, sorcière et figure historique québécoise qui, dans le récit fictionnel, serait l’ancêtre de Julie. L’histoire générale de la sorcellerie est également présente, de façon paratextuelle, grâce à un inventaire d’études véritables sur la sorcellerie inclus en fin d’ouvrage <note  place="end">En fin de roman, on trouve une courte bibliographie qui énumère dans la rubrique <title level="a">Ouvrages consultés</title> les ouvrages suivants : <title level="m">Magistrats et sorciers en France au <hi rend="small-caps">xviii</hi><hi rend="superscript">e</hi> siècle</title>, <title level="m">La sorcellerie au Québec du <hi rend="small-caps">xviii</hi><hi rend="superscript">e</hi> siècle</title>, <title level="m">Les dossiers secrets de la sorcellerie et de la magie noire</title>, <title level="m">Les sorcières et leur monde</title>, <title level="m">La sorcellerie</title>, <title level="m">La sorcière</title> et <title level="m">Les sorcières</title>.

En regroupant une pluralité de thèmes (religion, pauvreté, sorcellerie et ignorance), le réalisme magique produit ici une vision critique du contexte social. Grâce à ces thèmes, certaines valeurs traditionnelles ainsi que certains éléments négligés ou oubliés dans le contexte contemporain sont mis en évidence et contestés</ref></ref></ref>.</ref>

                            <ref target="#genre_fiction">Afin de réaliser une analyse des procédés sociocritiques du genre, il faut engendrer <hi rend="italic" xml:lang="la-VA">a priori</hi> une première analyse de la construction des personnages et des objets auxquels ils sont associés. <ref target="#voice_or_narration">Au-delà de la nature du genre, par essence contradictoire, Sœur Julie, la nonne-sorcière, est symbolique d’une ambivalence enrichie par un réseau éclaté et dispersé dans le roman sur plusieurs plans et niveaux narratifs</ref>. <ref target="#theory">J’emprunte le terme <q>ambivalence</q> à Mikhail Bakhtine, dont la contribution sur le carnavalesque et le grotesque a largement concouru à la riche production d’approches sémiotiques du genre réaliste magique. Comme l’explique Janet Paterson, le concept bakhtinien d’ambivalence renvoie à <q>l’union de sens contraires</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>62</bibl></note></ref>. <ref target="#religion">Quant à moi, j’entends par là que les intervertissements et les contradictions dévoilent le système d’inversions qui gouverne le texte. De nombreux objets (des tasses, des statuettes, des couteaux, des habits de nonne) — et pas seulement Julie — sont à la fois religieux et démoniaques. L’objet est ainsi mis en action dans la structure paradoxale du genre et il devient magique car il a été inséré dans un espace également paradoxal, celui du réel du texte (qui est paradoxal du fait que ce code dépend du réel hors texte tout en se posant définitivement comme de la fiction)</ref>. <ref target="#spatiality">C’est donc l’inversion spatiale qui modifie l’appartenance au code. Ainsi scindé par l’antinomie, l’objet (comme le réalisme magique) renvoie à la fois à l’ambivalence et à l’inversion. Nous avons vu que, dès son titre, <title level="m">Les enfants du sabbat</title> inspire une analyse portant sur les contrastes et les contradictions. Ainsi, comme l’explique Janet Paterson, <q>la <hi rend="italic">cabane</hi> des sorciers s’oppose et se juxtapose au <hi rend="italic">couvent</hi> des dames du Précieux-Sang et à la cellule de Sœur Julie, effectuant ainsi par un transcodage sémantique le passage entre deux espaces et deux signes</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>61</bibl></note>. Je voudrais souligner toutefois que, dans <title level="m">Les enfants du sabbat</title>, la magie n’est pas formellement liée à la cabane des sorciers. C’est au contraire dans le couvent des nonnes du Précieux-Sang que le surnaturel abonde. Comme Julie, l’objet devient magique lorsqu’il transgresse les bornes du passé de la Montagne de B… pour se caser dans le couvent</ref>.</ref>

Ces caractéristiques sont en réalité attribuables au genre, et ce roman en est riche. Voici par exemple comment Julie la sorcière a exercé sa volonté sur la pauvre sœur économe.

D’une voix de basse russe, elle fait des affaires […] Ils vendent, à perte, actions, obligations et propriétés, achètent très cher des savanes dans des régions perdues […] Fureur. Désespoir.

De nature subversive, la contestation s’insère à plusieurs niveaux du texte et va au-delà de la critique religieuse. Surtout, comme le constate Munley, elle prend des formes sanguinaires, violentes et scandaleuses (entre autres le viol de Julie, la naissance du bébé diable, les examens et les stigmates de Julie et l’épisode de sœur Gemma qui mange, couverte de sang animal, de la viande crue dans sa chambre)</ref></ref>.</p>

Les choix de Julie semblent étonnants car ils ne visent pas l’amélioration ou la morale. Respectant en cela la structure subversive du genre, voici comment Julie espère dépasser ses limites héréditaires : <q>Je triompherai là où Philomène a échoué. Je coucherai avec mon fils.

Ce n’est donc pas la raison qui prime sur l’ordre du monde maléfique. C’est, au contraire, dans ce monde inversé, Julie qui exerce son pouvoir de transformation et de libération. Elle se libère de la cabane pour la dépasser. Comme le note André Gaulin, elle constitue une figure féminine similaire aux autres figures féminines des romans d’Anne Hébert, qui <q>revendiquent chacune à leur manière un statut social, dans la révolte, dans le refus, luttent toutes du dedans contre un dehors aliénant</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>77</bibl></note>. Par cette confrontation des codes, Julie s’engage dans une libération qui donne naissance au réalisme magique, permettant ainsi de <q>[réveiller] les désirs cachés et les passions réprimées</q> <note place="inline"><bibl>English et Viswanathan 115</bibl></note>. Comme la logique du réalisme magique est interne, il est fort probable qu’elle ne propose aucune solution et, si solution il y a, rarement celle-ci sera-t-elle positive. <ref target="#theme_or_topic">Ce sont plutôt les renversements qui sont typiques, et qui illustrent bien les propos de Neil Bishop au sujet des thèmes de libération et d’enfermement : <q><ref target="#spatiality">le thème de la clôture spatiale, avec la signification fortement négative d’emprisonnement physique et psychologique qui s’y rattache, se renforce lors de la transgression des plus forts interdits, ce qui suggère ce que peut avoir d’illusoire, comme moyen de libération, ce recours à la sorcellerie</ref></q></ref> <note place="inline"><bibl>57</bibl></note>.</ref>

Écrire dans une veine réaliste magique, c’est se mettre au diapason de cette volonté libératrice, se pencher sur les structures qui forment un lien entre l’envisageable et l’impossible.

Chacun se positionne dans une situation de respect par rapport à l’autre, de reconnaissance d’ancienneté, de pouvoir et de genre féminin ou masculin. Chacun est plus jeune ou plus âgé (jeune frère ou sœur/grand frère ou grande sœur; grand-père ou grand-mère <hi rend="italic">éloignés</hi>— donc maternels — ou paternels, etc). <ref target="#spatiality">Il y a une scène dans le roman de Duong Thu Huong où deux petites copines réussissent à ne pas instituer entre elles de hiérarchie en rejetant toutes les formules d’appellation habituelles qui n’admettent pas d’égalité, et en se transformant en lieux respectifs, semblables, peut-être, au <q>hé, là-bas</q> français, où le pronom personnel est remplacé par un démonstratif spatial : <q>lieu-ci</q> (<hi xml:lang="vi-VN">đây</hi> = je) ou <q>lieu-là</q> (<hi xml:lang="vi-VN">đâý</hi> ou <hi xml:lang="vi-VN">đó</hi> = tu).</ref></ref>

                            <ref target="#textual_agency">Readers are material beings, placed in time and space, history and geography, and the material conditions of each reader have an inevitable impact on the reading experience. In this chapter, I address questions of how our understanding of literature may shift when we consider the materiality of the audience as well as of the text and of those responsible for its production. To increase awareness of the specificity of that material audience—in contrast to the widely studied concept of the mass audience—I focus here on two singular readers of one particular book. <ref target="#methodology">I seek to balance what I can ascertain about the readers against what I have been able to learn about the author, and against my assessment of at least some aspects of the text under consideration, <title level="m">Stand on a Rainbow</title> by Mary Quayle Innis. I then assess the conceptual implications of this tiny case study for how we may develop a principled literary map.</ref></ref>

                                <ref target="#textual_agency">As readers, we each have some sense of our own position in time and space, often almost by default. As students and scholars, we are sometimes invited to consider the importance of an author’s position in time and space. As contemporary lay readers (rather than scholars), we may also be encouraged to pay heed to the author’s persona as developed in websites, Twitter accounts, reading tours, and the like. None of these readerly stances is particularly rare; yet it is unusual to develop an awareness of a reading experience that takes account of the placement of both author and readers. One reason for the scarcity of such an approach, of course, is that readers are multiple and largely unknowable in that very plurality. <ref target="#genre">A book, simply by the fact of its existence, is designed on the broadcast model of one-to-many; to consider it in terms of one-to-one is to alter the exploration of its address in radical ways.</ref></ref>

In the <date  from="1950-01-01" to="1959-12-31">1950s</date>, my own mother regularly borrowed this book from the public library and read it over and over again; she described it as her favourite novel. <ref target="#response_re-evaluation"><ref target="#childhood">Curious about what it was that inspired her so greatly, I also read this book more than once—initially as a child of ten or eleven and later as an adult, purposefully looking back on my childhood reading experiences</ref>.

She could stand outside these experiences and revisit them, re-savour the felt life in a newly framed perspective, feel the force of its limitations as perceived by another, sympathetic point of view—and perhaps play with its possibilities and alternatives.</ref>

How much of the achievement of this novel lies in its creation of an interior life experienced within the confines of an inexorable and utterly accepted domesticity? Is it simultaneously a novel of protest? Leslie certainly does not question the conditions of her life; she seems only to question herself. <ref target="#textual_agency">In what ways is such a novel <q>readable</q> today?

In practical terms, that is certainly a basic truth about publishing and, in a way, marks the end of the story, so to speak.

If we confine our study of this novel to the limits of Mary Quayle Innis’s own trajectories, decisions, and life patterns, we distort the picture of a work of literature’s own movement through time and space. <ref target="#theme_or_topic">I have attempted to define two examples of the book’s trajectory after it left Innis’s hands through the actions and imaginings of two different, though related readers.</ref> <ref target="#textual_agency">The point about any novel, however, is that it is always in motion through time and space when it is being read, savoured, analyzed, and written about—<q>carded through</q> the lives of its readers. The significance of a reader’s placement in time and space is conventionally elided in much scholarly study, but that evaporation of the reader into some kind of impersonal analysis is itself a fiction. Even as we may have to create an empty set to represent the plurality of potential readers in time and space, we need also to make allowance for the located and specific nature of the scholar who presents <q>a</q> reading. No reader is disembodied; no reader exists outside of time and space. Acknowledging the force of that locatedness on the part of readers allows us to attend properly to the dynamics of reading that make literature what it is. Within the larger context of this scholarly collection, for example, this chapter is unusually autobiographical; but I bring the same history and experience to all my reading, no matter how neutrally and academically I write about a book.</ref></ref>

What would happen to our scholarship if the plenitude of digital space allowed us to consider a database category along the lines of <q>known readers of this novel,</q> for example?

In historical terms, these are not questions we may readily answer (although <ref target="#technology">digital point-of-sale information and radio frequency identification technology used in libraries</ref> may well enable us to gather more substantial statistics in the future).
