            <p>I have had no <ref cert="high" evaluate="all" target="https://www.cwrc.ca" xml:space="default">letter</ref> from <rs key="Lauren, Mark, 1972- | Body by you. | Français" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/9997159477587427990005/">you</rs> since I left <placeName cert="high" ref="http://www.geonames.org/2673722">Stockholm</placeName>, but I had a nice <ref target="https://cwrc.ca">one</ref>

               but he hadn't used it.</p>
            <p>When I reached Oslo <orgName key="Forum &amp;quot;Space Science: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&amp;quot; 2015 Moskau" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/8683154801923256310004/">yesterday</orgName> evening, Brynjulf <persName key="Bull, Chris" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/9972158070662808780002/">Bull</persName> should have been there to meet
               me, but wasn't. He is not on the telephone, so I took a taxi to his address, which
               turned out to be a <title key="Howell, David C. | Statistical Methods for Psychology" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/9972151051805333530003/" level="a">students</title>' club with no one about on Sundays, so I went to a hotel
               feeling rather non-plussed. But presently he turned up. He had got<pb n="2"/>

               on the right one. He left me at 10, and then I had to do a Sunday Referee article.
               Today my journey lasts from <time cert="high" evidence="internal" instant="unknown" precision="high" unit="cm" xml:space="default">9 till 9 -</time> fortunately one of the most beautiful railway

               Society. Next day I go back to <placeName key="Oslo" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q585">Oslo</placeName>, lecture there Fri. and Sat. and then start for
               home via Bergen.</p>

            <p>Bull is a nice young man but incompete<note type="scholarNote">dsa</note>nt - can't quite stand the communists, but
               finds the socialists too mild.</p>
